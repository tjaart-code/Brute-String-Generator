This code is a brute-force string generator that produces all possible combinations of strings using a specified character set. It accepts a minimum and maximum length, a prefix, and an optional output file to save the generated strings.

Example Usage:

python3 bruteStringer.py 3 5 abc "pre_" output.txt
This command would:
Generate strings of length 3 to 5.
Use the character set abc (i.e., generate combinations of "a", "b", and "c").
Add the prefix "pre_" to each generated string.
Save the output to output.txt.

Sample Output:
For min_length=3, max_length=4, charset="abc", and prefix="pre_", the output in the file could look like this:
pre_aaa
pre_aab
pre_aac
pre_aba
pre_abb
...
pre_acc
pre_baa
pre_bab
...
